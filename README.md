# Dual Motor RPM Measurement & PWM Control using Hall Sensor (Arduino)

This project measures the RPM (Revolutions Per Minute) of **two DC motors** using **Hall effect sensors** and dynamically controls motor speed using **PWM signals** generated by Arduino.

The system uses **interrupt-based pulse counting** for accurate RPM calculation and maps the RPM values to PWM outputs in real time.

---

## 🔧 Features
- Measures RPM of **two motors independently**
- Uses **hardware interrupts** for precise pulse detection
- Real-time RPM calculation every 1 second
- Automatic PWM speed adjustment
- Serial Monitor live feedback
- Scalable for EV, robotics, and automation projects

---

## 🧠 Working Principle
- Hall sensors generate pulses for each motor rotation
- Arduino counts pulses using interrupts
- RPM is calculated every second
- RPM values are mapped to PWM (0–255)
- PWM controls motor speed dynamically
